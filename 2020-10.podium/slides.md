# Code of Conduct

Hacktoberfest is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity,
religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate
harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is

# An Introduction to Open Source

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source

---
# Contributing to Open Source Projects

Open source software is freely available to use, redistribute, and modify.

Projects are transparent:

- Distributed peer review
- Open collaboration on code and documentation
- Helps enable diverse perspectives

---
# Which Projects

The best way to begin is to contribute to software that you already use.

As a user, you have a valuable perspective on what could be improved.

- Read the docs first
- Review the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the root of the project
- Get a sense of the community

Generally less polished projects are easier to get involved in.

---
# Start Small

- If this is your first time contributing to a project, start small
- Fix typos and improve documentation
- Each contribution is valuable

---
# Git

Git is the version control system used by almost all open source projects.

GitHub makes sharing and contributing to code much easier.

- Branch off the main or master branch
- Commit your changes
- Create a pull request to reintegrate your changes

---
# Check for Git

$ git --version
